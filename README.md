# advent-of-code-2016

A repository of my solutions for Advent of Code 2016. I chose to use JavaScript to see if it was possible to be competitive with the language. Although I never cracked the top 100, I frequently landed in the top 200-500. I may use a different language this year if Eric Wastl creates a new problem set for 2017.
